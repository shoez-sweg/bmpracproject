Alcohol-related liver dysfunction is a major public health issue in the United States, contributing to approximately 18,000 deaths annually and disproportionately affecting males aged 35–64. It encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions—including alcoholic fatty liver, hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis—caused by chronic excessive alcohol consumption. These conditions often progress silently, with elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) serving as early biomarkers of liver injury.
