Alcohol-related liver dysfunction (ALD) is a growing concern in the U.S., particularly among Hispanic males. Sleep duration has been identified as a potential modifier of metabolic and liver health, but its relationship to ALD remains unclear.

This study investigates the relationship between sleep duration and liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, GGT), and the combined impact of lifestyle factors (alcohol intake, BMI, physical activity) on ALD risk in Hispanic males aged 40–60 using NHANES 2007–2018 data.

Data from six NHANES cycles were merged and filtered for the target demographic. ALD risk was defined as AST/ALT ratio > 2 and GGT > 50 U/L. Median trends, boxplots, heatmaps, and nonparametric tests (Spearman, Kruskal–Wallis) were used to explore associations.

Median levels of all liver enzymes and independent variables were tracked across cycles, where ALT and AST levels remained generally stable, while GGT showed more variability. Results from data analysis show that no significant direct association was found between sleep duration and individual liver enzymes. However, higher ALD risk was observed among participants with shorter sleep duration in combination with heavy alcohol use and elevated BMI. Annual ALD risk trends remained low (<5%) but showed slight increases post-2013.

In conclusion, while sleep duration alone was not a strong predictor of liver enzyme elevation, its interaction with alcohol and BMI may contribute to increased ALD risk.

This project builds on existing clinical knowledge by applying validated ALD criteria to a large national dataset, investigating the novel role of sleep duration in ALD risk, and focusing on an underserved but vulnerable demographic.
